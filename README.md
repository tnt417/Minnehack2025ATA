**CommuniQuest - Made for Minnehack 2025**
Compete against others in your community with weekly photo prompts.

### Inspiration

We wanted to find an easy way to help people connect and get to know more about others
in their community. CommuniQuest is an app that turns sharing each others lives
with each other into a competition and a game that does something.

### Features

- Creating groups and inviting community members through an invite link
- Joining other people's groups to join in friendly competitions and meet new people
- Uploading pictures to match a prompt which is set for each week
- Voting on each other's submissions to decide a winner for each week
- Leaderboards to show off who is able to put out the group's favorites
- History to view past memories and highlights from previous weeks
